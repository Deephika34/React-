Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
-----------------------------------

HTTP1.1
-------
-> HTTP was published 1997. Its World Wide Web(WWW) protocol.
-> World Wide Web(WWW) which runs TCP/IP protocol stack.
-> HTTP is based on a client-server model. Its model is explained as two computers, a server and a client, that communicate via request and response.
    client model - Receiver of service
    server model - provider of service
-> Single request/reponse at a time, browser use multiple connection to achieve concurrent request and response
-> Request and response text based

HTTP2
-----
-> HTTP2 Published in 2015 for providing more improvements over http1.1
-> Its uses binary data for communication between client and server. faster web page loading compare to http1.1 protocol
-> Multiplexing : Multiple requests and responses are sent at a time over single connection
-> Supports HTTPS encryption protocol
-> to support flow control
-> Supports binary format which is more efficient than text based format used in HTTP1.1




2. Objects and its internal representation in Javascript:
-------------------------------------------------------

-> Objects are data types in javaScript
-> Objects are different than primitive data types(for eg:number, string, boolean, undefined,null)
-> Primitive data types contains one value but objects can hold many values for of key:value pair.
-> These keys can be variable or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively in the context of an object.
-> Every object has some property associated with some value

var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'Hyundai';
myCar.model = 'Creta';
myCar.year = 2015;

The syntax for adding property to an object is:
-----------------------------------------------
objectname.objectproperty =propertyvalue
myCar.color= 'White'

The syntax to access a property from an object is:
--------------------------------------------------
objectname.property (or)
objectname['property']
myCar.color
